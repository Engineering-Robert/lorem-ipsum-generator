# Lorem Ipsum Generator

Built a lorem ipsum generator using NodeJS. Used this [lorem ipsum generator](https://github.com/trohweder85/ipsum) as inspiration for this app. The application allows you the number of paragraphs you would like to generate and then shows a button that allows you to copy all of the text with a simple click.

## Running the App Locally

Begin by running app.js in your terminal with the command `node app.js` and then access the application in your browser at *localhost:3000*.

## Heroku App Deployment

In order to update the live application on Heroku, the command `git push heroku master` must be executed inside of the project folder.
