# Lorem Ipsum Generator

Built a lorem ipsum generator using NodeJS. Used knowledge gained from taking a course on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) as well as code from another [lorem ipsum generator](https://github.com/trohweder85/ipsum) as a basis for this app.

## Running the App Locally

Begin by running app.js in your terminal with the following command:

`node app.js`

Once the app is running, open your browser and go to the URL *localhost:3000* . The page should load with an input box where you can type an integer value corresponding with the number of paragraphs you would like generated with lorem ipsum text. Click the "generate" button and then the specified number of paragraphs should appear with random works related to technology.

## Updating Heroku App

From the terminal, run the command `git push heroku master` and you should be good to go!
